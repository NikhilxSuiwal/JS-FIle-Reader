The FileReader API is a JavaScript API that provides a way for web developers to read the contents of files from a user's local computer. It is a part of the HTML5 specification and is supported by modern web browsers.
The FileReader API allows web developers to access the contents of a file without having to upload it to the server first. This can be useful for websites that require users to upload files, such as image sharing websites, file storage services, or document editors.
